# Ez-Pomodoro
My first app for iOS platform based on swift language and swiftUI framework.
The app is bassicaly a timer which use pomodoro technique. So what it means: a timer set to 25 minutes (you supposed to be hyper-concintrated on your task), then 5 minutes brake, repeat 4 times, after that big break 25-30 mins.

Initial design was different, but decided to change it and make it easier to understand, simple but functional. Under the timer there are 4 images with less opacity which indicates the progress (how much rounds you did). Images initially have less opacity, after one full round, opacity is increased and image is fully visible. When every timer reach the end, alert appears, with different text, in dependence of timer.
